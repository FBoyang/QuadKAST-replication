We provide two examples of trait simulators:
1. base simulation: simulate under standard noninfinitesimal additive genetic architecture
2. large_hid_mar: base simulation + simulate large effect on the imputed data
3. het_noise: base simulation + heteroskedastic noise

Considering privacy issue, we do not provide the actual genotype data used for this simulation
