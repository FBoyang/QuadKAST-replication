base simulation: simulate under standard noninfinitesimal additive genetic architecture

Based on the base simulation, we add additional genetic archtectures as following:
1. large_hid_mar: base simulation + simulate large effect on the imputed data
2. het_noise: base simulation + heteroskedastic noise

Considering privacy issue, we do not provide the plink formatted genotype data used for these simulations.
