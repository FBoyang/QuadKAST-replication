# QuadKAST-replication

Scripts needed to replicate the [QuadKAST](https://github.com/sriramlab/FastKAST/tree/QuadKAST) analysis. Please refer to the README in each subdirectory for detailed script descriptions.

* var_comp: Simulation experiments related to the variance component analysis. This folder contains information for:
  * Statistics and script for the variance component analysis (Fig 1C, Fig S4).
  * Statistics, script & figures for feature importance analysis (Fig S8).
* ukbb_stats: Statistics related to UKBiobank real trait screening analysis. Specifically, it includes all the traits and genes being tested, and the corresponding summary level statistics. Used to produce contents in Table 1.
* timing: Time/ memory complexity analysis of QuadKAST (Fig 1D, Fig S7).
* power: Power analysis of QuadKAST (Fig B, Fig S6).
* calibration: Calibration analysis of QuadKAST (Fig 1A, Fig 3, Fig S2).
